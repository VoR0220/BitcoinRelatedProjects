All my bitcoin stuff/experimentation is going in here. 


For example, I'm currently writing that nice little testnet script you see there so that it isn't such a pain
to find the address and input it into the testnet faucet site. This way I will have my testing bitcoin quicker and 
with a lot less pain than searching through the wallet file and copying the data (particularly since I work with
bitcore). 

You should be able to run this by inputting the command as follows:

python quickTestNetBot.py [Wallet Address] 

and have it automatically inputted into tpfaucett....granted you will have to input the captcha....but god isn't that so much easier?
